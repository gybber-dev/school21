todo:

1. Makefile
2. Malloc set and free set. Is it realy so easy?


My check list:
1. Replace lines in map.cub
2. Put head lines after the map
3. Split map by empty line
4. Delete the last '\n' and make the last line like follow:
    '111111111\0'
5. Correct Makefile: not to build project when 'make' command is repeated.
6. Check for segafault. Go to the corner
7. Check if res1 = 0; or 0.000000000001
