My check list:
0. Checking extension of map-file:
	- rename map-file to ".cub" (4 characters). Waiting for map-name error
	- put map-file in sub-directory. Waiting for map-name error
1. Replace lines in map.cub
2. Put head lines after the map
3. Split map by empty line
4. Delete the last '\n' and make the last line like follow:
    '111111111\0'
5. Correct Makefile: not to build project when 'make' command is repeated.
6. Check for segafault. Go to the corner
7. Check if res1 = 0; or 0.000000000001
