todo:

1. auto_cleaner in ft_errors;
2. put error messages into struct
3. Segafault on corner 	1
						01 (make by lodev!)
4. In pressing two keys Player stops after release any second key.
5. Map is bigger than resolution


My check list:
1. Replace lines in map.cub
2. Put head lines after the map
3. Split map by empty line
4. Delete the last '\n' and make the last line like follow:
    '111111111\0'
5. Correct Makefile: not to build project when 'make' command is repeated.
6. Check for segafault. Go to the corner
