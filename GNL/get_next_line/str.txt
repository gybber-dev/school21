Calling your function get_next_line
in a loop will then allow you to read the text
available on a file descriptor one line at a
time until the EOF.
Make sure that your function behaves well when it reads from a file and when it 
reads from the standard input.
• libft is not allowed for this project. You must add a get_next_line_utils.c file
which will contain the functions that are needed for your get_next_line to work.
• Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx. which will be used
as the buffer size for the read calls in your get_next_line. This value will be
modified by your evaluators and by moulinette.
• Compilation will be done this way : gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32
get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
• Your read must use the BUFFER_SIZE defined during compilation to read from
a file or from stdin.
• In the header file get_next_line.h you must have at least the prototype of the
function get_next_line
